# Band Mom
A virtual tour manager for musicians

## Overview
Band mom is an app designed for musicians to plan and keep track of gigs and stay organized.

## Use Case
Let's face it, musicians are not known for being organized. From load in time to remembering that extra guitar cable, band mom is designed to keep track of it all. Beginning with a guided questionaire, band mom makes sure users have all of the information they need on hand for every gig they add.
